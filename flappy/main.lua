    Flappy Bird Remake James was here 2018

    A mobile game by Dong Nguyen that went viral in 2013, utilizing a very simple
    but effective gameplay mechanic of avoiding pipes indefinitely by just tapping
    the screen, making the player's bird avatar flap its wings and move upwards slightly.
    A variant of popular games like "Helicopter Game" that floated around the internet
    for years prior. Illustrates some of the most basic procedural generation of game
    levels possible as by having pipes stick out of the ground by varying amounts, acting
    as an infinitely generated obstacle course for the player.

    There is a bug in this game. It has to do with the fact 
    that under certain circumstances the bottom pipe 
    will not show at all. In PipePair.lua, we define 
    a gap height of 90. Then we use that fixed gap height 
    in defining the position of the bottom pipe. Then 
    in PlayState.lua, in the math.min method on line 45, 
    we use a hard-coded value of 90, which represents the 
    gap height, to calculate a number with a value of 
    VIRTUAL_HEIGHT - 90 - PIPE_HEIGHT. I have calculated 
    and demonstrated visually on the game that in some 
    cases, the draw point for the bottom pipe begins at 
    288, the bottom of the screen, thus not allowing it 
    to be seen at all. Since we have a minimum of 10 pixels 
    showing for the top pipe at all times, I have fixed 
    the code so that a minimum of a few pixels of the bottom 
    pipe, the top lip of the pipe, are visible above the 
    ground at all times.

    We are supposed to randomize the gap of the pipes. 
    In order to randomize the gap but also keep the 
    top of the bottom pipe always visible as it has been 
    fixed, it is necessary to use the random value generated 
    for the gap in both PlayState.lua and PipePair.lua. 
    To share that value, I discovered I have to create 
    the variable for the randomized gapHeight here in 
    main.lua. I then randomize it in PlayState.lua every 
    two seconds.

    gapHeight is not in all caps because it is no longer 
    a constant, just a global variable. Setting it 
    initially to a value of 60 really doesn't do 
    anything. I just thought it should have an initial 
    value.
